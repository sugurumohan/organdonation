    <h1>About lungs donation</h1>
    
    <p>The lungs is the main organ of the repiratory system.<br>
    
        A lung transplant is a surgical procedure to replace a diseased or failing lung with a healthy lung, usually from a deceased donor. A lung transplant is reserved for people who have tried medications or other treatments, but their conditions haven't sufficiently improved.<br><br>

        Depending on your medical condition, a lung transplant may involve replacing one of your lungs or both of them. In some situations, the lungs may be transplanted along with a donor heart.<br>
        
        While a lung transplant is a major operation that can involve many complications, it can greatly improve your health and quality of life. <br>
        <br>
        When faced with a decision about having a lung transplant, know what to expect of the lung transplant process, the surgery itself, potential risks and follow-up care.<br>
        Unhealthy or damaged lungs can make it difficult for your body to get the oxygen it needs to survive. A variety of diseases and conditions can damage your lungs and keep them from functioning effectively.<br> Some of the more common causes include:<br><br>
        Lung damage can often be treated with medication or with special breathing devices. But when these measures no longer help or your lung function becomes life-threatening, your health care provider might suggest a single-lung transplant or a double-lung transplant.<br>
